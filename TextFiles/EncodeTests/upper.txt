ON A SUNNY AFTERNOON IN THE PARK,
CHILDREN LAUGHED AND PLAYED TO THEIR HEARTS' CONTENT.
BIRDS CHIRPED JOYFULLY IN THE TREES ABOVE,
WHILE FAMILIES PICNICKED ON GREEN, LUSH GRASS.
THE SOUND OF A GUITAR FILLED THE AIR,
AS A STREET MUSICIAN ENTERTAINED PASSERSBY.
SQUIRRELS CHASED EACH OTHER AMONG THE TREES,
FINDING HIDDEN TREASURE IN CRACKS AND CREVICES.
A COOL BREEZE GENTLY SWAYED THE FLOWERS,
SPREADING FRAGRANCE AND JOY ALL AROUND.
IN THIS MOMENT OF PEACE AND HARMONY,
           "NATURE AND HUMANITY UNITED IN BLISSFULNESS."
