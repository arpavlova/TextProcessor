on a sunny afternoon in the park,
children laughed and played to their hearts' content.
birds chirped joyfully in the trees above,
while families picnicked on green, lush grass.
the sound of a guitar filled the air,
as a street musician entertained passersby.
squirrels chased each other among the trees,
finding hidden treasure in cracks and crevices.
a cool breeze gently swayed the flowers,
spreading fragrance and joy all around.
in this moment of peace and harmony,
           "NATURE AND HUMANITY UNITED IN BLISSFULNESS."
